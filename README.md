# Vulnerability and Penetration Testing Report

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted comprehensive Vulnerability and Penetration testing using Burp Suite and Qualys to assess the security of the Web Application. The testing revealed critical vulnerabilities including SQL injection, Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, and JWT configuration issues.

## Findings Summary

### Vulnerabilities Detected:

1. **SQL Injection:**
   Exploitable SQL injection points were found in the user authentication module, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database.

2. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
   Some endpoints lacked proper authorization checks, enabling unauthorized users to access sensitive data.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack:**
   Multiple input fields were found to be vulnerable to reflected and stored XSS attacks, posing a risk of executing malicious scripts.

4. **JWT Configuration Issues:**
   Weak JWT token configurations were identified, which could lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.

## Tools Used

- **Burp Suite:** Used for manual testing, scanning, and analyzing HTTP requests and responses to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Qualys:** Utilized for automated scanning and vulnerability assessment across the system's network.

## Recommendations

1. **Patch SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** Apply input validation and prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection risks.

2. **Enhance Authorization Controls:** Implement proper authorization mechanisms to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities.

3. **Sanitize Input Data:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.

4. **Strengthen JWT Configuration:** Configure JWT tokens securely, including encryption and proper validation checks.

## Conclusion

The Vulnerability and Penetration testing revealed critical security weaknesses, underscoring the importance of robust security measures. By addressing these vulnerabilities promptly, the system's security posture can be significantly improved.
